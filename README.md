YouTube Trending Videos Analysis
Project Overview
This project is an analysis of trending YouTube videos, focusing on identifying patterns and insights related to video engagement metrics such as views, likes, dislikes, and comments. The analysis explores how various factors influence video popularity and aims to uncover trends and correlations within the data.

Dataset
The data used in this project comes from the INDIAvi.xlsx file, which contains information on trending videos in India across various categories. It includes details such as video title, channel name, publish time, category, and metrics for views, likes, dislikes, and comment counts. Some columns in the dataset include missing values, which were handled during preprocessing.

Key Columns
video_id: Unique identifier for each video.
trending_date: Date when the video was trending.
title: Title of the video.
channel_title: Name of the channel that published the video.
views, likes, dislikes, comment_count: Engagement metrics.
publish_time: Original publish date and time of the video.
category_id: Numeric ID representing the video category.
comments_disabled, ratings_disabled, video_error_or_removed: Flags indicating video-specific restrictions.
Analysis Goals
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Remove rows with missing video_id values.
Fill missing description entries with "No description available".
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Generate summary statistics for understanding data distribution.
Visualize distributions of views, likes, dislikes, and comment counts with histograms (log scale).
Identify correlations among views, likes, dislikes, and comments using correlation matrices and scatter plots.
Hypothesis Testing:

Develop hypotheses based on observed relationships, such as:
A positive correlation between views and likes.
Time of publish may affect video popularity.
Dislikes might indicate a higher likelihood of video removal.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (or similar environment)
Libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
Install any missing libraries via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
File Structure
INDIAvi.xlsx: Dataset file containing YouTube trending videos data.
analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file with code for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
README.md: Project documentation.
Running the Analysis
Open the Jupyter Notebook: Open analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or another notebook environment.

Load the Dataset: Ensure the INDIAvi.xlsx file is located in the same directory as the notebook. Adjust the file path if necessary.

Run the Cells: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the data, perform preprocessing, and generate visualizations.

Results and Insights
Distribution Analysis: The distributions of views, likes, dislikes, and comments show a high level of variability, indicating that a small number of videos receive significantly higher engagement than others.

Correlations: The correlation matrix suggests strong positive relationships between views and likes, as well as between likes and comment counts.

Hypothesis Testing: Initial hypotheses were tested through visualizations and correlation analyses, revealing trends such as the impact of publish time and the relationship between dislikes and video removals.

Future Work
Implement machine learning models to predict engagement metrics.
Explore more granular trends by analyzing text data from video descriptions.
Perform deeper analysis on categories and channel-specific trends.
